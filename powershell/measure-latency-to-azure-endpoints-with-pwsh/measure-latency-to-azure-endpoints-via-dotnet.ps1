	With that script you could do your latency checks natively in PowerShell instead of leveraging psping, which might be more helpful when running it from Linux-based edge devices. It again connects to the endpoints specified in $endpoints hash table. You can also specify different ports to be used by just adding the desired port as :5061 or :80.
	
	It does now also provide support for proxy use - so when you have the requirement to use a proxy to connect to the internet, then try to run the script together with the $Proxy switch.
	
	By default it will make 4 consequent TCP connects to grab average timings (at least 3 connect attempts required) - you can adjust this by changing $iterations param. Beside of AVG it will give you also the MIN and MAX latency value - for the average the lowest and highest value will be excluded.

	To save your results when running the script in an automated way, simply run with the $ExportToCsv switch.
	
	EXAMPLE: 
		.\measure-latency-to-azure-endpoints-via-dotnet.ps1 | ft
		.\measure-latency-to-azure-endpoints-via-dotnet.ps1 -Iterations 10
		.\measure-latency-to-azure-endpoints-via-dotnet.ps1 -Proxy -Iterations 5
		.\measure-latency-to-azure-endpoints-via-dotnet.ps1 -ExportToCsv
		.\measure-latency-to-azure-endpoints-via-dotnet.ps1 -ExportToCsv -CsvFilepath c:\temp\results.txt
